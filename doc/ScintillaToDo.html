    <h2>
       Bugs and To Do List
    </h2>
    <h3>
       Scintilla Bugs
    </h3>
    <p>
       At the end of italics style runs characters can be chopped off. An example is using Verdana
      12 point italics for strings makes an ending double quote half visible and an ending single
      quote invisible. This is hard to solve completely, may be better to avoid these situations
      by, for example, choosing a font like Times New Roman for strings.
    </p>
    <p>
       Dragging over bold text in some fonts will ripple because of the difference in size between
      drawing all of a string at once and drawing it in parts.
    </p>
    <p>
	Python lexer does not understand escapes within triple quoted string like:
	"""String with embedded quote \""""
    </p>
    <h3>
       GTK+ Version Bugs
    </h3>
    <p>
       No DBCS or Unicode support.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Scintilla To Do
    </h3>
    <p>
       Simple pattern based styling.
    </p>
    <p>
       Line wrapping.
    </p>
    <p>
       Different height lines based upon tallest text on the line rather than on the tallest style
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
       Composition of lexing for mixed languages (such as ASP+ over COBOL) by
       combining lexers.
    </p>
    <p>
       Printing support on GTK+. Maybe Postscript output or use Gnome?
    </p>
    <p>
	Stream folding which could be used to fold up the contents of HTML elements.
    </p>
    <p>
	Persisting view state such as current folding into a stream or blob so it is easy
	to restore.
    </p>
    <p>
	Move line up and move line down keys or move selected lines up / down.
    </p>
    <h3>
	SciTE To Do
    </h3>
    <p>
	More lexers for other languages such as Delphi and Ruby.
	Make the subset Perl lexer understand more Perl.
    </p>
    <p>
	Printing on GTK+.
    </p>
    <p>
	Automatically loading changed files on GTK+.
    </p>
    <p>
	Tab bar on GTK+.
    </p>
    <p>
	Retain folding state when changing buffers.
    </p>
    <p>
	Comment / uncomment block.
    </p>
    <p>
	Load menus and accelerators from a property file so they can be modified
	easily and localised into other languages.
    </p>
    <p>
	Allow file name based selection on all properties rather than just a chosen few.
    </p>
    <h3>
	Features I am unlikely to do
    </h3>
    <p>
	These are features I don't like or don't think are important enough to work on.
	Implementations are welcome from others though.
    </p>
    <p>
	A VCL component wrapper around Scintilla so it can be used with Delphi or
	Borland C++ Builder.
    </p>
    <p>
	Automatically saving modified menu shortcuts on exit.
    </p>
    <p>
	Mouse wheel panning (press the mouse wheel and then move the mouse) on Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
	Adding options to the save dialog to save in a particular encoding or with a
	chosen line ending.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Directions
    </h3>
    <p>
       The main point of this development is Scintilla, and this is where most effort will go.
      SciTE will get new features, but only when they make my life easier - I am not intending to
      make it grow up to be a huge full-function IDE like Visual Cafe. The lines I've currently
      decided not to step over in SciTE are any sort of project facility and any configuration
      dialogs. SciTE for Windows now has a Director interface for communicating with a
      separate project manager application.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you are interested in contributing code, do not feel any need to make it cross platform.
      Just code it for your platform and I'll either reimplement for the other platform or ensure
      that there is no effect on the other platform.
