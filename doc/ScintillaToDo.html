    <h2>
       Bugs and To Do List
    </h2>
    <h3>
       Scintilla Bugs
    </h3>
    <p>
       At the end of italics style runs characters can be chopped off. An example is using Verdana
      12 point italics for strings makes an ending double quote half visible and an ending single
      quote invisible. This is hard to solve completely, may be better to avoid these situations
      by, for example, choosing a font like Times New Roman for strings.
    </p>
    <p>
       Dragging over bold text in some fonts will ripple because of the difference in size between
      drawing all of a string at once and drawing it in parts.
    </p>
    <h3>
       SciTE Bugs
    </h3>
    <p>
       There has been a report of SciTE exiting as soon as the mouse is moved over it when launched
      Start | Run. I have seen this once but can not find a way to reproduce it.
    </p>
    <p>
       One person has seen excessive waits (20 seconds) when using the file open dialog and
      changing to the top directory.
    </p>
    <h3>
       GTK+ Version Bugs
    </h3>
    <p>
       No DBCS or Unicode support.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Scintilla To Do
    </h3>
    <p>
       Simple pattern based styling.
    </p>
    <p>
       Line wrapping.
    </p>
    <p>
       Different height lines based upon tallest text on the line rather than on the tallest style
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
       Wider or differently shaped caret
    </p>
    <p>
       Composition of lexing for mixed languages (such as ASP+ over COBOL) by
       combining lexers.
    </p>
    <p>
       Make GTK+ version be more consistent with other GTK+ widgets.
    </p>
    <p>
       Printing support on GTK+. Maybe Postscript output or use Gnome?
    </p>
    <p>
       Stream folding which could be used to fold up the contents of HTML elements.
    </p>
    <h3>
       SciTE To Do
    </h3>
    <p>
       More lexers for other languages such as Delphi. Make the subset Perl lexer understand more Perl.
    </p>
    <p>
       Regular expressions in find functions.
    </p>
    <p>
       Remember tab size setting when switching between buffers.
    </p>
    <p>
       Printing on GTK+.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Directions
    </h3>
    <p>
       The main point of this development is Scintilla, and this is where most effort will go.
      SciTE will get new features, but only when they make my life easier - I am not intending to
      make it grow up to be a huge full-function IDE like Visual Cafe. The lines I've currently
      decided not to step over in SciTE are any sort of project facility and any configuration
      dialogs.
    </p>
    <p>
       If you are interested in contributing code, do not feel any need to make it cross platform.
      Just code it for your platform and I'll either reimplement for the other platform or ensure
      that there is no effect on the other platform.
