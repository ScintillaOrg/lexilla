    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Released on 23 May 2001.
      </li>
      <li>
	Loadable lexer plugins on Windows.
      </li>
      <li>
	Ruby lexer and support.
      </li>
      <li>
	Lisp lexer and support.
      </li>
      <li>
	Eiffel lexer and support.
      </li>
      <li>
	Modes for better handling of Tab and BackSpace keys within 
	indentation. Mode to avoid autocompletion list cancelling when 
	there are no viable matches.
      </li>
      <li>
	ReplaceTarget replaced with two calls ReplaceTarget 
	(which is incompatible with previous ReplaceTarget) and 
	ReplaceTargetRE. Both of these calls have a count first 
	parameter which allows using strings containing nulls.
	SearchInTarget and SetSearchFlags functions allow 
	specifying a search in several simple steps which helps 
	some clients which can not create structs or pointers easily.
      </li>
      <li>
	Asian language input through an Input Method Editor works 
	on Windows 2000.
      </li>
      <li>
	On Windows, control characters can be entered through use of 
	the numeric keypad in conjunction with the Alt key.
      </li>
      <li>
	Document memory allocation changed to grow exponentially 
	which reduced time to load a 30 Megabyte file from
	1000 seconds to 25. Change means more memory may be used.
      </li>
      <li>
	Word part movement keys now handled in Scintilla rather than 
	SciTE.
      </li>
      <li>
	Regular expression '^' and '$' work more often allowing insertion
	of text at start or end of line with a replace command. 
	Backslash quoted control characters \a, \b, \f, \t, and \v
	recognised within sets.
      </li>
      <li>
	Session files for SciTE.
      </li>
      <li>
	Export as PDF command hidden in SciTE as it often failed.
	Code still present so can be turned on by those willing to cope.
      </li>
      <li>
	Bug fixed in HTML lexer handling % before &gt; as end ASP
	even when no start ASP encountered. 
        Bug fixed when scripts ended with a quoted string and 
        end tag was not seen.
      </li>
      <li>
	Bug fixed on Windows where context menu key caused menu to 
	appear in corner of screen rather than within window.
      </li>
      <li>
	Bug fixed in SciTE's Replace All command not processing
	whole file when replace string longer than search string.
      </li>
      <li>
	Bug fixed in SciTE's MRU list repeating entries if Ctrl+Tab
	used when all entries filled.
      </li>
      <li>
	ConvertEOLs call documentation fixed.
      </li>
    </ul>

	Released on 17 April 2001.
      </li>
      <li>
	Bug fixed with scroll bars being invisible on GTK+ 1.2.9.
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
	Option in both Scintilla and SciTE to treat both left and right margin

      </li>
      <li>
	Caret line highlighting.
      </li>
      <li>
	Commands to delete from the caret to the end of line and

      <li>
	SciTE has menu options for recording and playing macros which are visible
	when used with a companion program that supports these features.
      </li>
      <li>

	Abbreviations are stored in a global abbrev.properties file.
      </li>
      <li>
	SciTE has a Full Screen command to switch between a normal window
	size and using the full screen. On Windows, the menu bar can be turned
	off when in full screen mode.
      </li>
      <li>
	SciTE has a Use monospaced font command to switch between the normal 
	set of fonts and one size of a particular fixed width font.
      </li>
      <li>
	SciTE's use of tabs can be controlled for particular file names 
	as well as globally.
      </li>
      <li>
	The contents of SciTE's status bar can be defined by a property and 
	include variables. On Windows, several status bar definitions can be active
	with a click on the status bar cycling through them.
      </li>
      <li>
	Copy as RTF command in SciTE on Windows to allow pasting
	styled text into word processors.
      </li>
      <li>
	SciTE can allow the use of non-alphabetic characters in 
	Complete Symbol lists and can automatically display this autocompletion 
	list when a trigger character such as '.' is typed.
	Complete word can be set to pop up when the user is typing a word and
	there is only one matching word in the document.
      </li>
      <li>
	SciTE lists the imported properties files on a menu to allow rapid 
	access to them.
      </li>
      <li>
	SciTE on GTK+ improvements to handling accelerator keys and focus 
	in dialogs. Message boxes respond to key presses without the Alt key as 
	they have no text entries to accept normal keystrokes.
      </li>
      <li>
	SciTE on GTK+ sets the application icon.
      </li>
      <li>
	SciTE allows setting the colours used to indicate the current
	error line.
      </li>
      <li>
	Variables within PHP strings have own style. Keyword list updated.
      </li>
      <li>

	Bug fixed with Scintilla on GTK+ positioning scroll bars 1 pixel 
	over the Scintilla window leading to their sides being chopped off.
      </li>
      <li>
	Bugs fixed in SciTE when doing some actions led to the start
	or end of the file being displayed rather than the current location.
      </li>
      <li>
	Appearance of calltips fixed to look like document text including
	any zoom factor. Positioned to be outside current line even when 
	multiple fonts and sizes used.
      </li>
      <li>
	Bug fixed in Scintilla macro support where typing Enter caused both a newline 
	command and newline character insertion to be recorded.

	operated on the document line instead of the visible line.
      </li>
      <li>
	SciTE command line processing modified to operate on arguments in order and in
	two phases. First any arguments before the first file name are processed, then the

	rather than changing the rest of the file to string style. This is less
	obtrusive and helps the folding.

      <li>
        Printing support in Scintilla on Windows.
      </li>
      <li>
        Styles can select colouring to end of line. This can be used when a file contains more than
        one language to differentiate between the areas in each language. An example is the HTML +
        JavaScript styling in SciTE.
      </li>
      <li>
        Actions can be grouped in the undo stack, so they will be undone together. This grouping is
        hierarchical so higher level actions such as replace all can be undone in one go. Call to
        discover whether there are any actions to redo.
      </li>
      <li>
        The set of characters that define words can be changed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Markers now have identifiers and can be found and deleted by their identifier. The empty
        marker type can be used to make a marker that is invisible and which is only used to trace
        where a particular line moves to.

        Windows version.
      </li>
      <li>
        SciTE can save a styled copy of the current file in HTML format. As SciTE does not yet
        support printing, this can be used to print a file by then using a browser to print the
        HTML file.

        Released on 17 May 1999.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changed name of "Tide" to "SciTE" to avoid clash with a TCL based IDE. "SciTE" is a
        SCIntilla based Text Editor and is Latin meaning something like "understanding in a neat
        way" and is also an Old English version of the word "shit".
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a SCI_AUTOCSTOPS message for defining a string of characters that will stop
        autocompletion mode. Autocompletion mode is cancelled when any cursor movement occurs apart
        from backspace.

        Executing programs works much better now.
      </li>
      <li>
        New palette code to allow more colours to be displayed in 256 colour screen modes. A line
        number column can be displayed to the left of the selection margin.
      </li>
      <li>
        The code that maps from line numbers to text positions and back has been completely

        Released on 30th March 1999, containing bug fixes and a few more features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Static linking supported and Tidy.EXE, a statically linked version of Tide.EXE. Changes to
        compiler flags in the makefiles to optimise for size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scintilla supports a 'savepoint' in the undo stack which can be set by the container when
        the document is saved. Notifications are sent to the container when the savepoint is
        entered or left, allowing the container to to display a dirty indicator and change its
        menus.
      </li>
      <li>
        When Scintilla is set to read-only mode, a notification is sent to the container should the
        user try to edit the document. This can be used to check the document out of a version
        control system.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is an API for setting the appearance of indicators.
      </li>
      <li>
        The keyboard mapping can be redefined or removed so it can be implemented completely by the
        container. All of the keyboard commands are now commands which can be sent by the
        container.
      </li>
      <li>
        A home command like Visual C++ with one hit going to the start of the text on the line and
        the next going to the left margin is available. I do not personally like this but my
        fingers have become trained to it by much repetition.
      </li>
      <li>
        SCI_MARKERDELETEALL has an argument in wParam which is the number of the type marker to
        delete with -1 performing the old action of removing all marker types.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tide now understands both the file name and line numbers in error messages in most cases.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tide remembers the current lines of files in the recently used list.
