      <li>
	Released on 6 November 2001.
      </li>
      <li>

	name clashes from system headers and also speeds up compilation. 
	Renamed DrawText to DrawTextNoClip to avoid name clash.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changed way word functions work to treat a sequence of punctuation as

        The user interface of SciTE can be localised to a particular language by editing 
	a locale.properties file.
      </li>
      <li>
        On Windows, SciTE will try to move to the front when opening a new file from
	the shell and using check.if.already.open.
      </li>
      <li>
        SciTE can display the file name and directory in the title bar in the form
	"file @ directory" when title.full.path=2.
      </li>
      <li>
        The SciTE time.commands property reports the time taken by a command as well 
	as its status when completed.

      </li>
      <li>

	by almost everything including Internet Explorer so should be available.

      TCL lexer which is just an alias for the C++ lexer so does not really 
      understand TCL syntax.
      </li>
      <li>
      Error lines lexer has styles for Lua error messages and .NET stack traces.

	(which is incompatible with previous ReplaceTarget) and 
	ReplaceTargetRE. Both of these calls have a count first 
	parameter which allows using strings containing nulls.

      <li>
	Word part movement keys now handled in Scintilla rather than 
	SciTE.
      </li>
      <li>
	Regular expression '^' and '$' work more often allowing insertion
	of text at start or end of line with a replace command.

	Copy as RTF command in SciTE on Windows to allow pasting
	styled text into word processors.
      </li>

	there is only one matching word in the document.
      </li>

	access to them.
      </li>

	they have no text entries to accept normal keystrokes.
      </li>
      <li>
	SciTE on GTK+ sets the application icon.
      </li>
      <li>

        SciTE has an extensibility interface that can be used to implement features such as
        a scripting language or remote control. An example use of this is the extlua module
        available from CVS which allows SciTE to be scripted in Lua.

        In 1.30, the new APIs are introduced but the old APIs are still available.
        For the GTK+ version, may have to include "WinDefs.h" explicitly to
        use the old APIs.
      </li>
      <li>
        "if" and "import" statements in SciTE properties files allows modularisation into
        language-specific properties files and choices based upon platform.
        This means that SciTE is delivered with 9 language-specific properties files
        as well as the standard SciTEGlobal.properties file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Much lower resource usage on Windows 9x.

        Option for printing magnified or miniaturised from screen settings.

        Auto-completion lists automatically size more sensibly.
      </li>
      <li>
        SCI_CLEARDOCUMENTSTYLE zeroes all style bytes, ensures all
        lines are shown and deletes all folding information.
      </li>
      <li>
        On Windows, auto-completion lists are visually outdented rather than indented.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close all command in SciTE.
      </li>
      <li>
        On Windows multiple files can be dragged into SciTE.
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        Scintilla provides SCI_CREATEDOCUMENT, SCI_ADDREFDOCUMENT, and

        Printing support in Scintilla on Windows.

      <li>
        Styles can select colouring to end of line. This can be used when a file contains more than
        one language to differentiate between the areas in each language. An example is the HTML +
        JavaScript styling in SciTE.
      </li>
      <li>
        Actions can be grouped in the undo stack, so they will be undone together. This grouping is
        hierarchical so higher level actions such as replace all can be undone in one go. Call to
        discover whether there are any actions to redo.
      </li>
      <li>
        The set of characters that define words can be changed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Markers now have identifiers and can be found and deleted by their identifier. The empty
        marker type can be used to make a marker that is invisible and which is only used to trace
        where a particular line moves to.

        Additional tool commands can be added to SciTE.

        Windows version.
      </li>
      <li>
        SciTE can save a styled copy of the current file in HTML format. As SciTE does not yet
        support printing, this can be used to print a file by then using a browser to print the
        HTML file.

        Released on 17 May 1999.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changed name of "Tide" to "SciTE" to avoid clash with a TCL based IDE. "SciTE" is a
        SCIntilla based Text Editor and is Latin meaning something like "understanding in a neat
        way" and is also an Old English version of the word "shit".
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a SCI_AUTOCSTOPS message for defining a string of characters that will stop

        GTK+ version now contains all features of Windows version with some very small differences.
        Executing programs works much better now.
      </li>
      <li>
        New palette code to allow more colours to be displayed in 256 colour screen modes. A line
        number column can be displayed to the left of the selection margin.
      </li>
      <li>
        The code that maps from line numbers to text positions and back has been completely
        rewritten to be faster, and to allow markers to move with the text.

        Released on 30th March 1999, containing bug fixes and a few more features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Static linking supported and Tidy.EXE, a statically linked version of Tide.EXE. Changes to
        compiler flags in the makefiles to optimise for size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scintilla supports a 'savepoint' in the undo stack which can be set by the container when
        the document is saved. Notifications are sent to the container when the savepoint is
        entered or left, allowing the container to to display a dirty indicator and change its
        menus.
      </li>
      <li>
        When Scintilla is set to read-only mode, a notification is sent to the container should the
        user try to edit the document. This can be used to check the document out of a version
        control system.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is an API for setting the appearance of indicators.
      </li>
      <li>
        The keyboard mapping can be redefined or removed so it can be implemented completely by the
        container. All of the keyboard commands are now commands which can be sent by the
        container.
      </li>
      <li>
        A home command like Visual C++ with one hit going to the start of the text on the line and
        the next going to the left margin is available. I do not personally like this but my
        fingers have become trained to it by much repetition.
      </li>
      <li>
        SCI_MARKERDELETEALL has an argument in wParam which is the number of the type marker to
        delete with -1 performing the old action of removing all marker types.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tide now understands both the file name and line numbers in error messages in most cases.
